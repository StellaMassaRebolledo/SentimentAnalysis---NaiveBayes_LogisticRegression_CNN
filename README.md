# Sentiment Analysis Using NaiveBayes, LogisticRegression and CNN
The purpose of this project is analyze and compare the results of a sentiment analysis using different algorithms to classify if a review is positive, negative or neutral. The algorithms used were Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Hyperparameter tunning was used for Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. 

## Data
The data used was the Magazine Subscription Reviews; it can be found here: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html.
The preprocessing was carried out by other members of the team. I developed the models using this preprocessed data. 

## Vectorization
For the vectorization, TF-IDF and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec) were used to compare the results of the classifiers with both. 

## Results
The best results were obtained with Logistic Regression using TF-IDF.
